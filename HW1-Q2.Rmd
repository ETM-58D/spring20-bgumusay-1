First we are downloading required packages and importing dataframes to R.

```{r echo=TRUE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
install.packages("readr", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(readr)

Boston <- read_csv("Boston.csv")
Boston[,"X1"]<- NULL
```

From the PCA we can see that we can explain 94% of the all data set by selecting only 9 variables. because of that we select comp.9 which gives us this formula Y=0.254crim+0.383zn+0.627indus+0.275ptratio-0.176dis-0.463rad-0.179tax-0.172lstat

It is seen as the positive variables are city center properties while the negative ones are the concerns related to the outside of the city center.

```{r}
pcaboston <- princomp(Boston, cor = T)
summary(pcaboston, loadings = T)
barplot(pcaboston$scores[,9])
```
